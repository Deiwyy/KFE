Kapa File Explorer

A simple file explorer with basic functions. Project made mainly for fun, I work on it when i feel kinda bored. 
I don't want to release it as an official piece of software by any means.

As for now, you can create new files, copy, delete and move files or directories. 
You can also kinda customize the program, just change what I call 'texts' in the txts.txt file (1.1.2 only). 

The syntax for these texts goes like this 

```
-[name of the key]
some text
you can use multiline too
=
```
